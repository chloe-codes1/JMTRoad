# error-boundary-react
Simple reusable react error boundary component for React 16+

git clone https://github.com/RatneshChauhan/error-boundary-react.git

Title
==============
React Error Boundary


Description
=================
A JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn’t break the whole app. To solve this problem for React users, React 16 introduces a new concept of an “error boundary”.
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

Usage
==========================
 
 <pre><span class="pl-k">import</span><span class="pl-smi"> ErrorBoundary</span><span class="pl-k"> from</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>react-error-boundary-component-fallback2<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>;

&lt;<span class="pl-ent"><span class="pl-c1">ErrorBoundary headerColor="lightseagreen" errorTitle="Error" errorText="Ooops! Something went wrong!" buttonType={['default', 'primary', 'secondary', 'disabled']} buttonLabel={['Ok', 'Continue', 'Close', 'Cancel']} modal={true} autoScrollBodyContent={false} customContentStyle={null}</span></span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="pl-ent"><span class="pl-c1">Your-Component</span></span> /&gt;
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent"><span class="pl-c1">ErrorBoundary</span></span>&gt;</pre>

* buttonType: Allows you to decide which button you want on the error dialog. You can keep one or all. Simply provide a blank value for the button type you don't want on the dialog
* buttonLabel: Allows you to provide labels of your buttons on the dialog. The order of button labels is same as that of your button types.
* autoScrollBodyContent: When set to true, gives you a vertical scroll on the dialog for its content.
* customContentStyle: Allows you to override default styling with your custom styling.
 

When error occurs during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them, a material-ui error dialog appears to the end user
